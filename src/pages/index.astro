It is a sector that is often not considered, yet touches the lives of all of us - through trade and logistics. Not only is it a sector that is expected to grow, but it is also a sector that is ripe for disruption, with lots of legacy systems still in place. My vision is to capture data on each container, including what it is carrying and where is it going - data fundamental not only to the maritime sector but the economy more generally. Maybe you've heard of <a href='https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/industry-4-0/' target='_blank' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>industry 4.0</a>, this is the road to 'Economy 4.0'.",

What naturally emerged in both crises is a shift towards distributed manufacturing - 3D printed ventilator valves or locally manufactured drone components are two examples.

          'The war in Ukraine has highlighted the cost advantage of using cheap drones to deliver firepower. Whilst the cost of one 155 Howitzer shell ranges from $2000 - $10,000, the cost of a cheap FPV drone is around $500. The future of warfare will be defined not only by the cost of weapons, but also the algorithms driving them. And, if drones can autonomously act in the same way that swarms of hornets to protect their nest, there is a huge tactical advantage. Currently, Ukraine is operating on a one-to-one drone-to-pilot ratio, which is not scalable. Combining modern AI with swarm control systems is a very viable option not only for the future of warfare. Networked swarm control systems could control fleets of autonomous vehicles to act as holistic transportation systems. The software layer of swarm control systems can be generalised to many domains, including transportation to logistics.',

          'European law states that EU countries must limit nitrogen emissions, and diesel generators emit a lot of nitrogen. The construction sector is a majour contributor of nitrogen emissions due to their use of diesel generators. Hence this legislation is already a blocker to construction in the Netherlands, which is experiencing a housing crisis. Other EU states are also bound to these laws, and are facing housing crises, such as Spain. There are already companies that can provide nitrogen-free energy, by means of hydrogen generators or large batteries, hence matching them with offgrid energy system providers could be a business opportunity.',
